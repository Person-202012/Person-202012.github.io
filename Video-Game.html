                        <p>Adri is the smallest of the group, so she is more agile and can dodge attacks but also isn't the strongest.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
            
        <p>(1)Select your hero<br>
        (2)Press Attack!<br>
        (3)If your enemy isn't dead, attack them again!<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Notes: The strength is the base damage, hacks are a multiplier that can increase damage and agility is the probabity of doging the attack. Stamina usually decreases damage because you are tired so you can't hit as hard, speed determins who attacks first, and cuteness reduces damage because who wants to harm a cute cat?
        <br>
        <br>
            Your enemy is randomly selected from 4 potential enemies, which are Ben, Devil, Pumpkin, and Wizy.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you wany extra info, you can open up th console by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I and clicking console. There, it will display stats and if you know how to use it, you can type a command to imidietly win.
