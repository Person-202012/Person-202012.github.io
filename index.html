        <p> I think that coronavirus is bad and the canadien parlament should pass a criminal law that says: If you are a virus and you infect a human, you will be liable for a term of imprisonement of not more than 1000 years or execution. Yep that's right I want to bring the death penalty to canada, albiet only for viruses. But we should sill be vigilant and wear masks, socially distance, wash our hands often, etc. A vaccine might end this pandemic if most people in a community get vaccinated. Hopefully the anti vaxers are a small enogh minority that they won'y prevent us from acheving herd immunity. Then, we can properly reopen everything that had to stay closed as of now because they conldn't socially distance.</p>

        <p> Hello everyone, welcome to my first post. Today I went to school at Fairview jr high. It is a jr high school in Fairview, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, North America, Earth, Solar System, Milkyway, Universe. I am in grade 7 so it is my first year at this school.<br><br> On the bus, there is an unwritten rule that the grade 7s sit in the front of the bus, the grade 8s sit in the middle of the bus, and the grade 9s sit in the back of the bus. It is not official but everyone just follows it. So ofcorse, I decided to break the rule yesterday because why the heck not? The grade 7s were the forst on the bus after school so we decided to sit in the back and see what happens. It was the first day of school this year and everything was diffrent from previous years because coronavirus. Luckily, I didn't get thrown out of the bus by the grade 9s. Since it was the first day, a lot of people were on the wrong buses and stuff like that so we didn't really get noticed all that much. Bye all see y'all next time I post!!!</p>
